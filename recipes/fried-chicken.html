    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 Chicken (fryer chicken either purchased cut up (recommended) or
        purchased whole and broken down into pieces)
      </li>
      <li>3 Egg</li>
      <li>2 cup Flour</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp Kosher Salt</li>
      <li>2 tsp Pepper</li>
      <li>1 tsp Garlic Powder</li>
      <li>1 tsp Paprika</li>
      <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, beat the eggs. In another bowl, combine the salt,
        pepper, garlic powder and paprika to make a seasoned salt. Add the flour
        to a third bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the chicken by first seasoning each piece of chicken to your
        taste with the seasoned salt. Then dip each piece in the egg and drag
        through flour until coated well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fill a large pot or deep fryer half full with oil and heat to 350°F.
        Place the chicken parts in and fry until dark and crisp. The thighs and
        legs will take longer to cook – about 15 minutes – than the breast and
        wings, which will take about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Remove from heat, let sit for 5 minutes to cool and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
